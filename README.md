This is the project repository for the C Compiler project for CS 660. The *flexbison/* folder contains the current project.
The *old_fbc++/* folder contains the old version of the project which requires [Flexc++](http://flexcpp.sourceforge.net/)
and [Bisonc++](http://bisoncpp.sourceforge.net/). Instructions for the current project are available in the *flexbison/* folder.

In order to view the documentation for this project on your personal computer, it must be recompiled
with Doxygen 1.8.3.1 in order to resolve link path differences between the development
computer and your computer. To compile the documentation, navigate to the flexbison/
directory and execute the following command:

    doxygen Doxyfile
    
After the documentation has been generated, open Nautilus (or a similar file browser)
and navigate to the flexbison/doc/html/ directory. Search for the 'index.html' file,
right click it and open it in a browser. At this point the documentation website 
will be visible.
