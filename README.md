CS 660 - Compiler Design
University of Nevada, Reno
Spring 2013 - Dr. Fred Harris

Authors: Alex Fiannaca, Matthew Sandeep

Description:

  This is the beginning of a simple C compiler being written for the CS660 
  Compiler course at the University of Nevada, Reno (Spring 2013). In order to
  compile the scanner and parser, you must use Flexc++ and Bisonc++ rather than
  the standard flex and bison.

How To: Compile this project

  Clone the repository using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/afiannac2/cs660.git

  This repository is a private repository, meaning that you must be granted 
  access rights before you can clone the repository, but since you are  
  reading this, I am guessing you have been given rights.

  Execute the following commands to compile the project:

    cd cs660/
    make

  Yes, its that easy...
